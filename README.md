# FAQ-Solution-WIth-NLP
This  is a mini project with very small dataset. The challange of this is that given a pair of FAQ with answers, the task is to provide the answer for a smilar set of Questions.

Approaches Taken

- Creating Random Baseline
- Applying BOW Techniques to predict with most semantic similarity on train questions
- Applying BOW Techniques to predict with most semantic similarity on train answers
- Applying DistillBERT's pretrained knowledge for encoing and subsequently computing cosine similarity to predict the probable answers
